Having a Newsletter subscription on your blog can be beneficial. It provides a way for you to keep your readers up to date with your content, drive traffic to your blog, and It is a great way to communicate with your readers.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up a Newsletter on your Next Js blog with Mailchimp.

### Why Mailchimp?
MailChimp is a popular online marketing tool that you can use to manage your email list when you start getting subscribers. They have a free version for people with 2000 contacts or less. It's good enough for people beginning their newsletter journey.

### Mailchimp Setup
To get started, [create an account with Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/help/create-an-account/). When a user subscribes to your newsletter, the email address is added to your `Audience`. Mailchimp gives you `API Keys` that you can use in other apps to access your account.

To connect to the API we will need three environmental variables from Mailchimp;

- [your generated API Key](https://mailchimp.com/help/about-api-keys/#find+or+generate+your+api+key)
- [API Server](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/guides/quick-start/#make-your-first-api-call)
- [Audience Id](https://mailchimp.com/help/find-audience-id/)


### Get started with Next Js

We will need a form to collect the userâ€™s email and an API that will receive the form submission and save the email on Mailchimp. Luckily, NextJs provides us with the ability to do both without creating a separate backend application using NodeJs.

All we need to create a simple API is to create a pages/api folder in our next Js application. Next Js will map any file inside to /api/* directory and it will becomes an endpoint instead of a page.

We can now begin by creating a fresh NextJs application by running the following command.

```js
npx create-next-app@latest
```

### Setup environment variables for development and production
It's best practice to store environment variables in `.env` files, do not push your environment variables to your remote branch. remember to add the `.env.local` file to .gitignore.

**Local Setup**

Create a `.env.local` file. file in the root folder of your next js application. Place your environment variables in that file:
```js
MAILCHIMP_API_KEY="your-mailchimp-api-key"
MAILCHIMP_AUDIENCE_ID="your-mailchimp-audience-id"
MAILCHIMP_API_SERVER="your-api-server-prefix"
```

**Production Setup**

I have my blog app deployed on Netlify. 

[To add these variables to Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/environment-variables/), go to Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment > Edit Variables.

[Add environment variables in Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables).

### Create Server-side API request

Create `pages/api/subscribe.js` and paste the following code inside it: 

```jsx
import axios from 'axios'

export default async (req, res) => {
  const { email } = req.body

  if (!email || !email.length) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Email is required' })
  }

  const API_KEY = process.env.MAILCHIMP_API_KEY
  const API_SERVER = process.env.MAILCHIMP_API_SERVER
  const AUDIENCE_ID = process.env.MAILCHIMP_AUDIENCE_ID
  
  const url = `https://${API_SERVER}.api.mailchimp.com/3.0/lists/${AUDIENCE_ID}/members`

  const data = {
    email_address: email,
    status: 'subscribed'
  }

  const options = {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      Authorization: `api_key ${API_KEY}`
    }
  }

  try {
    const response = await axios.post(url, data, options)
    if (response.status >= 400) {
      return res.status(400).json({
        error: `There was an error subscribing to the newsletter. Shoot me an email at ogbonnakell@gmail and I'll add you to the list.`
      })
    }
    return res.status(201).json({ message: 'success' })
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error)
    return res.status(500).json({ error: error.message })
  }
}
```
[Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) provides a simple and clean way for us to make API requests. We are importing it inside the `subscribe.js` file because we will use it to make a post request to the [Mailchimp marketing API](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/api/list-members/add-member-to-list/). Be sure to install it using the following command:

```js
npx install axios
```

We are creating an async function that takes a `request` and `response` as parameters. This is the function that handles our API request.

The If block adds a validation check so that the email request body isn't an empty string.

Use `process.env` to grab the env variables, update the Mailchimp URL with the env variable.

Create a data object containing the email address and a subscribed status. An `option` object that tells the content type and sets the authorisation header to your `api_key`.

The code in the `try block` makes a post request to the URL endpoint using axois with the data and options passed in as parameters. 

If the email input field is empty or invalid, a 400(bad request
) status error response is returned, else a 201(created) status response is returned. In case of any other errors, a 500 server error is returned. 

**Note**: It's important to be sure of the arguments Mailchimp API takes. While working on this, I added a `first name` input field to the data object and the API kept returning a 500 server error. I studied what the Mailchimp API takes in as arguments and that solved the server response problem for me. That is after trying to get a form field for `first name` and `email` to work. The moral of this part is to be sure of the data structure the  API will need before creating the frontend UI for it.

To add additional params, [see the full list of available params](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/api/list-members/add-member-to-list/).

### Create Newsletter form component
 Now we have an API that takes an email and submits it to Mailchimp API. Let's create the client-side UI where user can input their email to subscribe. I used `styled-components` for styling the form component.

Create a `Subscribe.js` file in `src/components` folder with the following code:

```jsx

function Subscribe() {

  const [email, setEmail] = useState('')
  const [state, setState] = useState('idle')
  const [errorMsg, setErrorMsg] = useState(null)

  const subscribe = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    setState('Loading')

    try {
      const response = await axios.post('/api/subscribe', { email })
      console.log(response)
      setState('Success')
      setEmail('')
    } catch (e) {
      console.log(e.response.data.error)
      setErrorMsg(e.response.data.error)
      setState('Error')
    }
  }

  return (
    <SubscribeContainer>
      <h4 className="sub-header">Subscribe to the newsletter</h4>
      <p className="sub-text">
        Get to notified on quality articles about frontend development and more
        sent to your inbox. I'll send you an email once a month, no spam.
      </p>
      <form onSubmit={subscribe}>
        <SubFormContainer>
          <div className="form-input">
            <input
              required
              id="email-input"
              name="email"
              type="email"
              placeholder="What's your email address"
              value={email}
              onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
            />
          </div>
          <div className="sub-form-btn">
            <button
              disabled={state === 'Loading'}
              type="submit"
              className="form-btn"
              onClick={subscribe}
            >
              Subscribe
            </button>
          </div>
        </SubFormContainer>
        {state === 'Error' && (
          <ErrorState className="error-state">{errorMsg}</ErrorState>
        )}
        {state === 'Success' && (
          <SuccessState>Awesome, you've been subscribed!</SuccessState>
        )}
      </form>
    </SubscribeContainer>
  )
}

export default Subscribe

```

In this component, I am creating three state variables:
- email 
- loading
- error

When a user clicks the `Subscribe button`, *Subscribe function* is called.
The state is set to `Loading` while the request is being made to the API.

Based on the response we get, the state is either set to `Success` for a successful submission or `Error` and returns an error message.

While waiting for the server response, the state is set to `Loading`, the button is set to `disabled`. I did this to prevent users from clicking the button again and as a way to let them know their request is processing.

```jsx

{
  state === 'Error' && (
    <ErrorState className="error-state">{errorMsg}</ErrorState>
  );
}
{
  state === 'Success' && (
    <SuccessState>Awesome, you've been subscribed!</SuccessState>
  );
}

```
This displays the API response to the client. If there are no errors, the email is added to your Mailchimp audience dashboard.

### Fix API route not found in a Next.js App Production Environment.

Be sure to test your subscription form in the production environment. While my subscribe form worked well locally,  I discovered it wasn't working in production. It returned a `404 not found` error. The reason was that [API Routes can't be used with next export](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction#caveats). After removing `next export` from my build script, It worked as expected.

**Final Result**
